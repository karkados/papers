Title:
Holography in aerodynamic Meteorology from BVOCs and Software development

Introduction:
This paper presents the technique of using Holography
for measuring particles in the atmosphere
with a laser.
Jacob Fugal et al have made some great devices
but they haven't calibrated the instrument
until now. O.Schlenczek et al already added
more software background to analyze those 
so calles holograms of ice or water particles.

Simulations:

Methodology:
We use HALOHOLO and Matlab for postprocessing as described in A.BCD 2011.

Results:
The instrument and software did a fair job of catching the basic information
about ice particles in clouds.

Conclusion:
Perfect. Science has been rewritten!
